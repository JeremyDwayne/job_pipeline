Ignore this doc if you're not me. I'm just using this to keep track of my thoughts and ideas. I'll be updating this file as I go along.

## Company

- Decide when a company should be created.
  - Initial thought is when a job application is created, the company should be created as well if it doesn't already exist.
  - Display a dropdown of companies when creating a job application, if the company doesn't exist, give the user the option to create it.

## Job Application

  - what fields are needed on creation

## Interview

  - Phone Screen
    - Recruiter
